		<p>.RIXP is a file extension, that is used for RixxyPlayer. Like in <a href="/docs/uploader">The Uploader</a>, if there was no Uploader/.RIXP, we would need to type again, and again, and so on.</p>
		<p>If you try to open your project, you will see a comment that verfies if the file was made with RixxyPlayer. If you delete the comment, I will pop-up a dialog in which is said that the file is insecure. If you edit what's <strong>below</strong> the comment, the script will not be transformed to the code. How? It's because the content below is a Base-64 encoding of the code that someone wrote.</p>
